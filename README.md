TANAP Segmentation 

This program takes in directories containing page scan XML data from the National Archives, generated by LOGHI and outputs “inferred” document boundaries with respect to the inventory. Each scan page can be classified as either (“START” - The starting page of a document, “END” - The ending page of a document, “MIDDLE” - A middle page in-between a start and end page, “NONE” - A page outside of a document, such as table of contents, or blank pages). The output given by the program is a two-column csv file contains the scan file name and its denoted page boundary.

 How to Run:
1. Make sure you have a folder/directory containing only xml files from a specific inventory
2. In the “dist” folder, double-click the file “segmentation_gui” executable file. It might take a few moments for the screen to appear.
3. Once the program appears, simply choose the location of your xml files and select the correct model and encoder*
4. In the program make sure to tick the box that says “53 features”

* For this version select “label_encoder53.joblib” and “xgb_53_best_model.joblib”
